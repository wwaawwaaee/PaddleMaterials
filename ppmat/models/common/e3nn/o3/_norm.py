    Parameters
    ----------

        representation of the input

    squared : bool, optional
        Whether to return the squared norm. ``False`` by default, i.e. the norm itself (sqrt of squared norm) is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    Compute the norms of 17 vectors.

    >>> norm(torch.randn(17 * 3)).shape
    torch.Size([17])
